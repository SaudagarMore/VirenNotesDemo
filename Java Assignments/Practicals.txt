3. Develop a Java program that calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual based on their gender, weight, height, and age. The program should then determine and report whether the individual is 
underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese based on their BMI.
BMI Calculation:
Convert height from centimeters to meters.
Use the formula BMI = weight / (height in meters * height in meters) to calculate BMI.
BMI Classification:
Based on the calculated BMI, classify the individual into the following categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Healthy: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30

1.Sales Commissions) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. 
The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. 
For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. 
Write an application (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salesperson’s salary is truncated to an integer amount): a) $200–299 b) $300–399 c) $400–499 d) $500–599 e) $600–699 f) $700–799 g) $800–899 h) $900–999 i) $1000 .
