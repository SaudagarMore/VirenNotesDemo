1. Add User-Input Numbers to LinkedList
 Method(s): add()
Prompt the user to enter 5 integers and add them to a linked list. Display the full list.

2. Insert Elements at First, Last, and Specific Position
 Method(s): addFirst(), addLast(), add(index, e)
Using default data:
Add "Start" at the beginning
Add "Middle" at index 2
Add "End" at the end
Print the final list.

3. Search Name in List (User Input)
 Method(s): contains()
Add 5 default names to a list. Ask user to enter a name. Check if it exists using contains() and print “Found” or “Not Found”.

4. Remove Element by Index (User Input)
 Method(s): remove(int index)
 Add 6 city names. Ask user for an index and remove the element at that index. Show updated list.

5. Remove First and Last Elements
 Method(s): removeFirst(), removeLast()
Add 5 fruit names to a list. Remove the first and last element. Print the updated list.

6. Get and Display Elements from Positions
Method(s): getFirst(), getLast(), get(index)
Create a list with 5 default elements.
Show the first, last, and middle (index 2) elements using get methods.

7. Count Elements and Clear the List
Method(s): size(), clear(), isEmpty()
Add 4 default colors to a list.
Print the size
Clear the list
Check and display if the list is now empty

8. Count Even Numbers (User Input)
 Method(s): add(), get(index), size()
Take 5 integers from user, add to LinkedList. Count how many are even numbers and print the count.

9. Compare First and Last Element
 Method(s): getFirst(), getLast()
Add 5 elements. Check if first and last elements are the same. Print "Same" or "Different".

10. Display List in Reverse (Without Using Built-in Reverse)
Method(s): get(index), size()
Add 5 default items to the list. Print them in reverse order using a loop (without reversing the list itself).

Practical-Based Stack Questions
 Covers methods like:
push(), pop(), peek(), search(), isEmpty()

1. Push and Pop User Integers
 Method(s): push(), pop()
Ask user to enter 5 numbers and push them to stack. Then pop all and print one by one (LIFO order).

2. Peek at Top Element
 Method(s): push(), peek()
Push 3 strings into a stack. Use peek() to show the current top element without removing it.

3. Search Element in Stack
 Method(s): push(), search()
Push 4 default items (e.g., [10, 20, 30, 40]). Ask user to input a number. Use search() to find and print its position from top. If not found, print -1.

4. Pop Until Stack is Empty (Default Data)
 Method(s): isEmpty(), pop()
Push 5 default items to a stack. Keep popping and printing until isEmpty() returns true. If empty, print “Stack is empty.”

5. Simulate Undo Feature
 Method(s): push(), pop(), peek()
Simulate typing:
Push “Type A”, “Type B”, “Type C”
On "Undo", pop the last command
Show the current top using peek()
