2)Find the index of first occurrence Modify the above program to print the index of the first occurrence of the number if found, else print "Not Found".
3)Input an array of n integers. Input a number x. Count how many times x appears in the array.
4)Input a 2D array (matrix) of size m x n. Input an element x. Use linear search to find if x is present in the matrix.
5)Write a program to input n numbers into an array and find the largest element using linear search.
6)Input a 2D array and use linear search logic to find the smallest element in the matrix.
