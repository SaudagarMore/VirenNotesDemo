Java Assignment:1). JDBC CRUD Application on Person Table
Assignment Title:Person Management

To develop a Java console-based application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC 
on a Person table. The application ensures email uniqueness during the creation of a new person record.

Entity: Person
Field	
id	int	Auto-incremented primary key
name	
email	
age	
city	
phoneNumber	

Functional Requirements:(problems)
i)Create a new person
Validate if the email already exists
If it exists, display: Error: Email already registered.
Otherwise, insert the new record
ii)Read person(s)
iii)View all persons
iv)View person by ID
vi)Update a person
Update any field (name, email, age, city, phone) by ID
vii)Delete a person
Delete person by ID

Requirements:
Use Java JDBC to connect to a MySQL
Use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection.
Use Database connection pooling (optional for extra credit).
Use console-based menu to interact with the user.
Handle SQL exceptions gracefully.

Java Assignment:2) JDBC CRUD Application with Aggregate Functions & Stored Procedures
Assignment Title:Product Inventory Management  

Develop a Java JDBC console application to manage products in an inventory system. 
The application must support standard CRUD operations, utilize aggregate SQL functions, 
and interact with stored procedures defined in the database.

Entity: Product
Field	
product_id	INT	Auto-incremented primary key
name	
category
price	 
quantity
The combination of name and category must be unique (to avoid duplicates).

Requirements:
CRUD Operations:
i)Create a new product
Check if a product with the same name and category already exists
If yes, show: Error: Product already exists in this category.
ii)Read product(s)
iii)View all products
iv)View product by ID
v)Update product details (name, category, price, quantity)
vi)Delete a product by ID

Aggregate SQL Operations:
vii)Calculate total inventory value
Use: SUM(price * quantity)
viii)Show highest priced product
Use: MAX(price)
ix)Show average price by category
Use: AVG(price) GROUP BY category
x)List products with stock below a threshold

Stored Procedure Usage:
Stored Procedure to Increase Stock Quantity
xi)Create a stored procedure to increase the stock of a product by product ID:

Java Assignment 3: JDBC CRUD Application with Aggregate Functions & Stored Procedures
Assignment Title: Student Course Management

Build a Java JDBC console application to manage student records and their enrolled courses. 
This system must support CRUD operations, use aggregate SQL functions, and execute stored procedures.

Entity: Student
Field	
student_id	INT	Auto-incremented primary key
name	
email	
department	
semester
gpa	

Email must be unique (prevent duplicates)

Functional Requirements:
CRUD Operations:
i)Create a new student
Validate email uniqueness
ii)Read: All students
iii)Student by ID
iv)Update: Any student field by ID
v)Delete:Student by ID

Aggregate SQL Operations:
vi)Show average GPA by department
Find student(s) with highest GPA

Count total students in each semester
vii)Stored Procedure:
Create a stored procedure to promote a student to the next semester:

Requirements:
Use Java JDBC with MySQL
Use PreparedStatement
Menu-driven console app
Handle SQL exceptions gracefully

name	
email	
department
salary	
joining_date	DATE	Date of joining

Email must be unique

Functional Requirements:
CRUD Operations:
i)Create a new employee Prevent duplicate emails
ii)View all employees or by ID
iii) Update employee details using id
iv)Delete employee by ID

Aggregate SQL Operations:
v)Calculate total payroll cost
vi)Find highest-paid employee
vii)Show average salary by department
viii)List employees joined after a specific date

Stored Procedure:
ix)Create a stored procedure to add a fixed bonus to all employees in a specific department:

Requirements:
Java JDBC with MySQL
