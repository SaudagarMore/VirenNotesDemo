1. Add and Display Elements (User Input & Looping)
Main Task:
Take 5 string inputs from the user and add them to a LinkedList.
After insertion, display all elements.
Add one more element "Extra" at index 2 using add(int, E).
Replace the last element with "Final" using removeLast() followed by addLast().

2. Insert at Specific Position and Validate
Main Task:
Take 3 elements from the user. Insert one at index 1.
Try inserting at index greater than the current size – handle the exception.
If the list already contains the value to be inserted, skip insertion and print a message.

3. Add to Beginning and End + Check for Duplicates
Main Task:
Ask the user for two names: one to add at beginning and one at end.
Before adding, check if the name already exists in the list using contains().
If it does, ask for a new name.
Display the first and last elements using getFirst() and getLast().

4. Retrieve Elements and Handle Edge Cases
Main Task:
Add 4 elements manually to the list.
Try retrieving elements at index 0, 2, and out-of-bound index 5.
Print a message if index is invalid (use try-catch).
Display the entire list using a loop.

5. Search and Replace if Found
Main Task:
Ask the user for a name to search in the list.
If the element exists, remove it using remove(int) and replace it with "Updated" at the same index.
If not found, add the new element to the end.

6. Remove by Index and By Value
Main Task:
Add 5 values and display them.
Ask the user to enter a value to remove.
If found, remove it.
If not, print "Element not found".
Then remove the element at index 2.
Finally, remove the first and last elements using removeFirst() and removeLast().

7. Size, Clear, and Condition-Based Clear
Main Task:
Add any number of values until user types "done".
After all insertions, display the size of the list.
If size > 5, clear the list automatically.
Otherwise, print “List is safe”.

8. Reverse LinkedList (Manual Stack Simulation)
Main Task:
Add 6 elements and reverse the list.
Don't use Collections.reverse().
Create a new LinkedList and move elements from the original using removeLast() and add() to simulate a reverse.
Display both original and reversed lists.

9. Input Until Stop + Even/Odd Name Separation
Main Task:
Keep accepting names from user until "stop" is typed.
Add even-length strings to one LinkedList and odd-length strings to another.
After all inputs:
Display both even and odd name lists.
Remove the first item from each.
Print the updated lists and their sizes.

10. Menu-Driven Advanced LinkedList Program
Main Task:
Implement a menu:
1. Add at end
2. Add at beginning
3. Remove by index
4. Check if list is empty
5. Get element by index
6. Display list
7. Clear list
8. Exit
If user chooses to get an index that's out-of-bounds, print “Invalid index”.
If trying to remove from an empty list, print a warning.
After every operation, print the list and its size.
Allow user to perform at least 5 operations in one run.
