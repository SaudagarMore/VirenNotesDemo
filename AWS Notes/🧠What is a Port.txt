🧠What is a Port? 
In computer networking, a port is like a door or gate through which data enters or leaves a computer.

A computer or server may run many services (like websites, email, file sharing).
Each service uses a different port to send or receive data.

🧍‍♂️💡 Real-Life Example: A Big Office Building

Imagine a big office building (computer/server):

* Inside the building, there are many departments: HR, Finance, IT, Sales, etc.
* Each department has its own room number.
* When a courier comes to deliver something, they need to know:

  * The building address (IP address)
  * The room number (port number)

📦 Courier = Data
🏢 Building = Computer or Server
🚪 Room Number = Port Number

So, if the data is a request to open a website (like google.com), the courier goes to the building (IP address) and delivers it to the Web Department (Port 80).

🌐 Technical Side: Common Port Numbers

Here are some common services and their port numbers:

| Service             | Port Number |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| HTTP (Web)          | 80          |
| HTTPS (Secure Web)  | 443         |
| FTP (File Transfer) | 21          |
| SSH (Secure Login)  | 22          |
| SMTP (Send Email)   | 25          |
| DNS (Find websites) | 53          |

🛠️ Why Are Ports Useful?

They help the computer know which service to talk to.
Without ports, all data would get mixed up. Think of trying to deliver a parcel to a building with no room numbers — chaos!
