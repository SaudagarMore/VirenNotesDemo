Cloud Computing V23


🌐 Introduction to Cloud Computing

Traditional Way (Before Cloud)

* Watch movies using DVDs or store files on USBs.
* Buy and manage physical servers (costly, complex, time-consuming).
* Scaling up = more money, time, and headache.
* If traffic drops, unused servers = waste of money.

Cloud Way

* **Access computing resources (servers, storage, apps)** via the Internet.
* Hosted in **remote data centers** (aka "the cloud").
* Pay only for what you use (**pay-as-you-go**).

💡 Why Cloud Computing?

1. **Pay-as-you-go** – No upfront investment.
2. **Scalable & Flexible** – Increase/decrease resources instantly.
3. **Fast** – Deploy in minutes, not months.

🚀 Popular Cloud Providers

* **AWS** (Amazon Web Services)
* **Azure** (Microsoft)
* **GCP** (Google Cloud Platform)

☁️ Types of Cloud Services

| Type                                   | Description                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Rent virtual servers, storage, networking |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)       | Full development/deployment environment   |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service)       | Ready-to-use apps (e.g., Gmail, Netflix)  |

🔸 AWS (Amazon Web Services)

* First launched in **2006**
* Started with **S3** and **EC2**
* Now over **200+ services** (AI, ML, security, etc.)

 Who Uses AWS?

Netflix, NASA, eSports, many others.

 Market Share (Q2 2024):

* **AWS**: 32%
* Microsoft: 23%
* Google Cloud: 12%

---

🖥️ What is a Server?

* A machine that serves resources to users (like Paytm app backend)
* Can be **physical** or **cloud-based**

---

🔧 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

* Virtual server in the cloud
* Run apps, store data
* Only pay for what you use
* Easy to **scale up/down**

Key Features:

* Different instance types (t2.micro, etc.)
* OS options (Linux, Windows)
* Secure login (key pair)
* Supports **auto-scaling** and **load balancing**

---

 📋 EC2 Instance Lifecycle

* **Pending** → Launching
* **Running** → Active
* **Stopping** → Shutting down
* **Stopped** → Off (not billed)
* **Terminated** → Deleted

---

 🧱 Steps to Create an EC2 Instance

1. **Name & Tags** – e.g., `web-server`, `env: production`
2. **Select AMI** – Choose OS
3. **Instance Type** – e.g., t2.micro (1 CPU, 1GB RAM)
4. **Key Pair** – Secure access (public & private key)
5. **Network & Security** – VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
6. **Firewall Rules (Security Group)**

   * SSH: 22
   * HTTP: 80
   * HTTPS: 443
7. **Storage (EBS)** – Default: 8GB, Max: 16TB
8. **Advanced Settings** – Scripts, behavior, placement, etc.

 🗄️ AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

* **Object storage** for files, videos, photos, etc.
* Infinite scalability
* Secure, reliable
* Used by BBS to preserve 100 years of data!

 S3 Concepts:

* **Bucket** – Container for files
* **Object** – File (data + metadata)
* **Key** – Unique object name
* **Region** – Physical storage location
* **Storage Classes** – Cost vs. Access options

---

🪜 Steps to Create S3 Bucket

1. Login to AWS Console
2. Open S3
3. Click **Create Bucket**
4. Choose **Name**, **Region**
5. Set options: encryption, versioning
6. Set permissions
7. Click **Create**

---
 📦 S3 Storage Classes

| Class                | Use Case                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Standard             | Frequent access          |
| Intelligent-Tiering  | Smart switching for cost |
| Standard-IA          | Infrequent access        |
| One Zone-IA          | Infrequent, single zone  |
| Glacier              | Archive                  |
| Glacier Deep Archive | Long-term archive        |

---

 🔐 S3 Permissions & Security

* **IAM Policies** – Who can access what
* **Bucket Policies**
* **ACLs** – Legacy permissions
* **Encryption** – SSE or Client-side
* **Versioning** – Recover deleted or old files
* **MFA Delete** – Extra protection

---

🧾 Bucket Naming Rules

* 3–63 characters
* Lowercase letters, numbers, `-` and `.`
* Must start and end with a letter or number
* No adjacent dots or IP-like names

---
 📤 Uploading Files to S3

* **GUI** – Web console
* **CLI** – Command line
* **API**
* **SDK**

---

💾 Free Usage Limit

* 5TB free for S3 bucket size

---

 🌀 Versioning

* Maintains **copies** of the same file
* Helps recover deleted or overwritten files
* Each file version has a **unique ID**
* Disabled by default, can be enabled

---

✅ Summary

* Cloud computing saves time, money, and effort
* AWS is the **leader** in cloud services
* EC2 → For compute (virtual server)
* S3 → For storage (infinite capacity)
* Everything is **scalable**, **secure**, and **pay-as-you-go**
