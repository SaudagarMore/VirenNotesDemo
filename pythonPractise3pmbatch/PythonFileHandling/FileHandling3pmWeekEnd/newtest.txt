10. Abstract Classes  and method
a. Abstract Classes
An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be inherited by other classes. It may contain one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation).
Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for all subclasses.
 In Python, abstract classes are created using the ABC class from the abc module.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

b. Abstract Method
An abstract method is a method that is declared in the abstract class but has no implementation (i.e., the method body is not defined).
Subclasses must override and implement all abstract methods of the abstract class; otherwise, they also become abstract.
 Abstract methods are marked using the @abstractmethod decorator.Child classes must override it.
