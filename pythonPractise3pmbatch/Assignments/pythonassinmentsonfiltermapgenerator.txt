1)List=[10,52,63,48,79]
Given a list of numbers, use map() to return a list of their squares.

2)create a list add 10 items from user and a list of integers, use filter() to get only the divisible by 3  numbers.

3)String["Python", "is", "Platform", "independent", "proramming", "language"]
Given a list of lowercase strings, use map()  to convert all to uppercase.

4)create a list as Test[] add 10 string values from user
and filter only those with more than 5 characters using filter()

5)Ask the user to input an alphanumeric string. Use filter()  to extract all digits from it.

6)Given a list of strings, return a list with all strings reversed using map().

7)Write a generator function that yields numbers from 1 to N (user input).

8)Write a generator to generate the first N Fibonacci numbers.

9)Write a generator that yields even numbers up to a user-specified limit/numers.

10)Write a generator that yields prime numbers up to a user-defined limit/numbers.

11)Use a generator expression to calculate squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

12)Write a generator that yields only numbers divisible by 3 from 1 to N.

13)Write a generator that yields each character of a string (user input) one by one.

14)Convert a predefined list of items into a generator and print all elements one by one.

15)Write a generator that counts down from N to 0 (input from user).
