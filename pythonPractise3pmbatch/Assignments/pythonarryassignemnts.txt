1)Create an array of type 'i' (signed int) and fill it with the squares of all even numbers between 1 and 50.

2)Write a program that accepts a list of floats, stores them in an array of type 'f', and then replaces all negative values with their absolute values.

3)Construct an array of type 'i' with 20 random integers between 100 and 200. Remove all prime numbers from the array in-place.

4)Create an array of type 'd' (double float), and rotate it left by k positions, where k is user input.

5)Write a program to create two arrays of type 'i'. Merge them such that the resulting array is sorted in descending order and has no duplicates.

6)Create an array of type 'i' containing the first 15 Fibonacci numbers. Then reverse the array using slicing.

7)Accept user input to build an array of type 'u' (Unicode characters). Then remove all vowels from it and print the resulting array.

8)Generate an array of type 'i' with 30 integers. Split it into two separate arrays: one for even indices and one for odd indices.

9)Create a floating-point array ('f') representing temperature readings for 7 days. Replace every temperature below 0 with the average of all temperatures.

10)Create an array of type 'i' with elements from 1 to 100. Remove all elements that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both.

11)Initialize an array of type 'i' with random integers. Implement an in-place bubble sort algorithm using only array operations (no Python list methods).

12)Write a function that accepts a string and returns an array of type 'u' containing only the unique characters in sorted order.

13)Build an array of type 'f' using user input, then normalize the values between 0 and 1 using the formula (x - min) / (max - min).

14)Create an array of type 'i' and implement a binary search algorithm on it without converting it to a list.

15)Design a program that reads an array of type 'i' and compresses consecutive duplicates into one. E.g., [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] becomes [1, 2, 3].

16)Create an array of type 'd' with 20 random float numbers. Round each value to 2 decimal places and store them in a new array.

17)Using an array of type 'i', write a program to calculate the prefix sum (cumulative sum) of the array and store it in a new array.

18)Accept a sentence from the user. Store each word’s length in an array of type 'i', then display the word with the maximum length using only array operations.

19)Write a program that takes a Unicode character array ('u'), and shifts each character forward by 2 in Unicode (like a Caesar cipher).

20)Create an array of type 'i' and implement your own version of the insert(index, value) method (without using the built-in insert() method).
