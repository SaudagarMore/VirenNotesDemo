1)Given arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write a program to replace every even-indexed item with 0 using __setitem__().

2)Ask the user for 5 Integers and store them in a list.and then store into empty array Then count and print take a number from user and find that number is
present or not into that array and if found print the occurance of that numers how many times that appears.

3)Create a arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Use slicing and __getitem__() to print the last three items.

4)Take a array from the user and use __contains__() to filter record from array and and Print how many numbers are divisible by 4 in array

5)Given a array of 10 integers, remove all even numbers using a loop and remove() method. Print the updated array.

6)Create two array using user input. Extend the first array with the second using extend(), then sort it and print the result.

7)Given arr = [5, 3, 9, 1], sort it, then reverse it, then use __getitem__() to find and print the third-largest element.

8)Write a program that creates a array of 10 random integers from 1 to 50. Use __iter__() to iterate and print only values greater than 25.
